# NetOS-Detect: Automated OS Detector:

NetOS-Detect is a powerful and modular tool for network administrators and security
professionals to automatically discover and identify the operating systems of devices
on a network. It combines passive analysis with active scanning techniques to provide
an accurate inventory of network assets.

üöÄ Features

‚óè Host Discovery: Automatically discovers live hosts on a target network using ARP
and ICMP scans.

‚óè Passive Fingerprinting: Identies operating systems stealthily by analyzing
existing network trac (e.g., TTL, TCP Window Size, Banners).

‚óè Active Scanning: Performs sophisticated active scans using craed packets to
accurately determine the OS of target hosts.

‚óè Reporting: Generates reports on network composition and discovered devices.

‚óè Modular Architecture: Easy to extend with new detection techniques and
features.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites:

‚óè Python 3.8+

‚óè pip (Python package installer)

‚óè libpcap or Npcap (for packet capturing with Scapy).

‚óã Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

‚óã Windows: Install Npcap during the Scapy installation process.

1. Clone the repository:

   
   git clone https://github.com/Richie13root/NetOS-Detect.git

   cd NetOS-Detect

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   
   python -m venv venv
   
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 Ô∏è Usage:
 
  The core detection logic can be run from the command line. You must run the script
  with administrator/root privileges to allow for raw socket operations.

  On Linux/macOS

  sudo python detector.py --target 192.168.1.1

  On Windows (in an Administrator terminal)

  python detector.py --target 192.168.1.1
